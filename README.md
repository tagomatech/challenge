# Q-Variance Challenge

Can any continuous-time stochastic-volatility model reproduce the parabolic relationship  
σ(z) = √(σ₀² + z²/2)  
across 352 assets and all horizons 1-26 weeks with R² ≥ 0.99 and ≤ 2 free parameters?

Here z = x/sqrt(T) where x is the log price change over a period T, adjusted for drift. Read the paper Q-Variance_Wilmott_July2025.pdf for more details.

Quantum baseline (Orrell 2025): R² ≈ 0.998

Repository contains:
- Data set (prize_dataset.parquet) containing price data for 352 stocks from the S&P 500 (stocks with less than 25 years of data were not included)
- Full dataset generator (data_loader.py) to show how the data was generated
- Scoring engine
- Live leaderboard
- Baseline quantum fit
- Plot Figure_1.png showing q-variance and R^2 value
- Plot Figure_2.png showing the first 100 stocks.

**How to Submit to the Q-Variance Challenge Leaderboard**

1. Fork this repository
2. Place your model output in `submissions/your_team_name/` as:
   - `prize_dataset.parquet` (must have columns: ticker, date, T, z, sigma)
3. Add a `README.md` in your folder with:
   - Team name
   - Short model description
   - Contact (optional)
4. Open a Pull Request titled: "Submission: [Your Team Name]"

GitHub Actions will automatically run `score_submission.py` and post your score.

**Prize Rules**
- Must use **variance** (sigma²)
- Must cover **all 352 stocks** and **T = 5,10,...,130 days**

Good luck.


**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: Is q-variance a well-known "stylized fact"?

A: No, a stylized fact is just a general observation about market data, as opposed to a firm prediction. Q-variance is a falsifiable prediction because the multiplicative constant on the quadratic term is not a fit, it is set by theory at 0.5. The same formula applies for all period lengths T.

Q: Is q-variance a large effect?

A: Yes, the minimum variance is about half the total variance so this is a large effect. If you are modelling variance then you need to take q-variance into account.

Q: Has q-variance been previously reported in the literature?

A: Not to our knowledge, and we have asked many experts, but please bring any references to our attention.

Q: Does q-variance have implications for finance?

A: Yes, it means that standard formulas such as Black-Scholes or the formula used to calculate VIX will not work as expected.

Q: Is q-variance related to the implied volatility smile?

A: Yes, but it is not the same thing because q-variance applies to realized volatility.

Q: Is q-variance related to the price-change distribution over a period?

A: Yes, it implies that price-change follows the q-distribution which is a particular time-invariant, Poisson-weighted sum of Gaussians.

Q: Can I use AI for the challenge?

A: Yes, AI entries are encouraged.
